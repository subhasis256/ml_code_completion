Large projects such as kernels, drivers and libraries follow a code
style, and have recurring patterns. In this project, we explore learning based
code recommendation, to use the project context and give meaningful
suggestions.
Using word vectors to model code tokens, and neural network based learning
techniques, we are able to capture interesting patterns, and predict code that
that cannot be predicted by a simple grammar and syntax based approach as in
conventional IDEs.
We achieve an absolute prediction accuracy of XX\% on Linux kernel, a C
project, and YY\% on Twisted, a Python networking library.
